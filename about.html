			<p>Since graduating Humber College’s, Acting for Film and Television Program I have been, with great excitement, venturing out into the beautiful world of acting. Over the past year, I have continued to hone my craft as an actor, having had the blessings and incredible experiences of being both on stage and on-set.</p>

			<p>I am so grateful to have had the experiences of being in three theatre productions, Barefoot in the Park (<a href="http://theatrescarborough.com/#">Scarborough Players</a>), Sense & Sensibility (<a href="https://amicusproductions.wordpress.com/">Amicus Productions</a>) and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (<a href="http://fools.ca/">A Company of Fools</a>). Other credits that I have are, <i>Chapparal</i>, directed by Elizabeth Lazebnik (BravoFactual), <i>Swerve</i>, directed by Jason Armstrong (Skeleton Key Films Inc.) along with working alongside Michael Kennedy (credits include, <i>Little Mosque on the Prairie</i>) and Arthur Cooper (credits include, <i>Shoot the Messenger</i> and <i>Room</i>).</p>
