			<p>As a recent graduate of Humber College’s, Acting for Film and Television Program I am incredibly excited to venture out into the beautiful world of acting. I have honed my craft as an actor, and know that my learning and exploring in this vast business, has not stopped just because I no longer walk through the Humber halls.</p>

			<p>This is just the beginning!</p>

			<p>I am so grateful to have had the experiences of being in two theatre productions, while training at Humber in both, <i>Spoon River</i> (written by, Edgar Lee Masters), directed by Maria Ricossa, as well as, <i>The Woods</i> (written by, David Mamet) directed by Dixie Seatle. Other credits that I have are, <i>Beyond the Forest’s Edge</i>, directed by Nicole Segal (Humber College), along with working alongside Michael Kennedy (credits include, <i>Little Mosque on the Prairie</i>) and Arthur Cooper (credits include, <i>Shoot the Messenger</i> and <i>Room</i>).</p>
