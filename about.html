            <p>
            Since graduating Humber College’s, Acting for Film and Television Program I have been, with great excitement, venturing out into the beautiful world of acting. Over the past several years, I have continued to hone my craft as an actor, having had the blessings and incredible experiences of being on stage, on-set and in a recording studio.
